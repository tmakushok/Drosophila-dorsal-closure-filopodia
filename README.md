This code is created for the detection of Drosophila dorsal closure leading edge and of filopodia protruding from the leading edge. Here is a video representative of the type of microscopy data this code was developed for: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsOAWh8Tg-k.

Main steps of the analysis:
1) Detection of the perimeter of the dorsal closure leading edge;
2) Detection of filopodia within the dorsal gap;
3) Linking the filopodia to the leading edge and measuring the angles between the filopodia and the leading edge;
4) Accumulating the data extracted from individual images for the entire time lapse dataset.
